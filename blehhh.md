### Pending Frontend Work ðŸš§
The following features have backend support but need template implementation:
- Loading animations for login, imports, and form submissions
- Profile picture display in student dashboard
- Book cover display in manage books table
- Student profile picture display in manage students table
- Transaction toggle buttons (show/hide returned/borrowed)
- Shopee-style grid template for student books page
- Librarian management templates (manage, add, edit, delete)
- System settings template updates

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Web Framework
- **Django 5.2.7** on Python 3.11 - Full-stack web framework handling authentication, ORM, templating, and admin interface
- **Rationale**: Django provides a batteries-included approach with built-in admin panel, robust ORM, and authentication system suitable for institutional applications
- **Database**: SQLite for local development (configured for easy migration to PostgreSQL/MySQL in production)

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Custom User Model** extending Django's AbstractBaseUser - Supports three user types: student, admin, and POS
- **Admin Approval Workflow** - Students register but require admin approval before gaining system access
- **Transaction Approval System** - Book borrowing requests created by POS staff require admin approval before inventory is updated
- **Role-Based Access Control** - Separate dashboards and permissions for each user type

### Data Models

**Core Entities:**
- **User** - Custom authentication model with user_type field (student/admin/pos)
- **Student** - Extended profile with student_id, course, year, section, verification status, and approval status
- **Book** - ISBN-based catalog with title, author, category, publisher, inventory tracking (copies_total, copies_available)
- **Transaction** - Groups multiple book borrowing/returns into single transactions with approval workflow
- **TransactionItem** - Links individual books to transactions, tracks borrowed_date, return_date, and status per book

**Key Design Decision - Transaction Grouping:**
- Multiple books can be borrowed in a single transaction rather than creating separate transactions per book
- When a student borrows 7 books, the system creates 1 transaction with 7 TransactionItem records instead of 7 separate transactions
- This simplifies tracking, approval workflow, and batch returns

### Frontend Architecture
- **Tailwind CSS** via CDN - Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design
- **Alpine.js** - Lightweight JavaScript framework for interactive components (mobile menu, modals)
- **Font Awesome** - Icon library for UI elements
- **Django Templates** - Server-side rendering with template inheritance (base.html pattern)
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach with hamburger menus and adaptive layouts

### Business Logic Workflows

**Student Registration Flow:**
1. Student verifies their ID against pre-loaded student database
2. Student completes registration with email, phone, profile photo, and password
3. Admin reviews and approves/rejects registration from pending list
4. Upon approval, student can log in and view borrowing history

**Book Borrowing Flow:**
1. POS operator scans/enters student ID
2. POS operator scans/enters ISBNs for multiple books
3. System creates pending transaction with all books
4. Admin reviews and approves/rejects transaction
5. Upon approval, book inventory decreases and student can collect books
6. System generates transaction code for tracking

**Book Return Flow:**
1. POS operator enters transaction code
2. System displays all borrowed books in that transaction
3. POS operator selects books to return (supports partial returns)
4. System updates TransactionItem status and increases book inventory
5. Transaction status updates to "returned" when all books are returned

### File Upload & Media Handling
- **Student profile photos** stored in MEDIA_ROOT/student_photos/
- **CSV Import** - Bulk import of students and books via CSV file upload
- Django's FileField/ImageField for file handling

### Admin Interface
- **Django Admin** - Built-in admin panel at /django-admin/ for database management
- **Custom Admin Dashboard** - Separate admin interface at /admin/ with:
  - Statistics cards (total students, books, borrowed books, available books)
  - Quick actions for pending approvals
  - CSV import tools
  - Student and book management interfaces

### URL Routing Structure
- `/` - Login page
- `/student/dashboard/` - Student borrowing history and profile
- `/admin/dashboard/` - Admin statistics and management
- `/pos/home/` - POS kiosk main menu
- `/pos/borrow/` - Multi-step book borrowing workflow
- `/pos/return/` - Transaction-based book return workflow

### Security Considerations
- CSRF protection enabled for all forms
- Password hashing via Django's PBKDF2 algorithm
- Login required decorators on protected views
- CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS configured for Replit deployment
- File upload validation for images and CSV files

## External Dependencies

### Python Packages
- **Django 5.2.7** - Web framework
- **Pillow** - Image processing for profile photos
- **django-crispy-forms** - Form rendering helper
- **crispy-tailwind** - Tailwind CSS templates for crispy forms

### Frontend Libraries (CDN)
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling framework
- **Alpine.js 3.x** - JavaScript reactivity
- **Font Awesome 6.4.0** - Icon library

### Database
- **SQLite** - Default database (production should use PostgreSQL or MySQL)
- Migration files track schema evolution

### Email Service (Currently Disabled)
- Email functionality removed in favor of admin approval workflow
- EMAIL_HOST configuration exists but is not actively used
- Future implementation could add email notifications for approvals

### Static Files & Media
- Static files served from `/staticfiles/` during development
- Media files served from `/media/` during development
- Production deployment should use proper static file hosting (S3, CDN, or web server)

### Deployment Configuration
- Configured for Replit deployment with wildcard ALLOWED_HOSTS
- CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS set for *.replit.dev and *.repl.co domains
- DEBUG mode enabled (should be disabled in production)
- SECRET_KEY should be moved to environment variables in production
